===========

The event-driven architecture is extremely loosely coupled because the event 
itself doesnâ€™t know about the consequences of its cause. 
Such loose coupling makes the application more flexible, but it increases the 
complexity of the logic of the whole system. 
For a system with large number of components and modules the search of code that 
led to a particular result can be fairly complex.

In this regard, there are two significant limitations to operate with events:

1. All event listeners must be registered in `Es\Events\Listeners`.
2. The registration of events and listeners should be performed only with 
   configuration files.

The system itself must provide the code, that performs configuration of events 
and listeners using the configuration files. The user code must only provide the
necessary configuration files.

In addition, these limitations make it possible to cache all registered events.
